# N-Queen-problem
The N-Queen Problem is a classic backtracking challenge: place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. This means no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The goal is to find all possible valid arrangements or one valid solution for a given N.
